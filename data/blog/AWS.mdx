Workshop Overview:
Data durability and recovery are critical aspects of any modern cloud infrastructure. 
In this workshop, you will learn how to create highly available solutions using Amazon Web Services (AWS) to ensure the resilience of your data. 
We will focus on building a Multi-AvailabilityZone, Multi-Region database, and a versioned website hosting solution to mitigate data loss and accidents. 
By the end of this workshop, you will have the skills to architect and deploy robust AWS solutions that can withstand failures and disasters.

## Workshop Agenda:
1. Introduction to Data Durability and Recovery in AWS
    Understanding the importance of data durability and recovery
    Overview of AWS services for building highly available solutions
2. Building a Multi-AvailabilityZone, Multi-Region Database
    Setting up Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) for multi-AvailabilityZone deployment
    Configuring cross-region replication for data redundancy and disaster recovery
3. Demonstrating failover and recovery scenarios across multiple AWS regions
    Implementing Versioned Website Hosting Solution
    Setting up Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) for static website hosting
    Configuring versioning for S3 buckets to enable easy rollback in case of accidental data deletion or corruption
    Integrating Amazon CloudFront for global content delivery and improved website performance
4. Hands-on Lab: Building and Testing Highly Available Solutions
    Participants will follow step-by-step instructions to deploy a multi-AvailabilityZone, multi-Region database and versioned website hosting solution on AWS
    Guided exercises to simulate failure scenarios and practice recovery procedures
5. Best Practices and Advanced Considerations
    Discussing best practices for designing resilient architectures in AWS
    Exploring advanced features and services for enhancing data durability and recovery, such as AWS Backup, AWS Disaster Recovery, etc.

## Code Blocks

Some Javascript code

```javascript
var num1, num2, sum
num1 = prompt('Enter first number')
num2 = prompt('Enter second number')
sum = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2) // "+" means "add"
alert('Sum = ' + sum) // "+" means combine into a string
```

Some Python code üêç

```python
def fib():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:            # First iteration:
        yield a            # yield 0 to start with and then
        a, b = b, a + b    # a will now be 1, and b will also be 1, (0 + 1)

for index, fibonacci_number in zip(range(10), fib()):
     print('{i:3}: {f:3}'.format(i=index, f=fibonacci_number))
```
