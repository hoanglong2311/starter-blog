I am Long Hoang Nguyen, a skilled Software Engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from FPT University, Da Nang, Vietnam. With a GPA of 9.0/10.0, I have consistently ranked among the top students in my program and have received honors for my academic achievements.

My technical expertise encompasses a range of programming languages and tools including Java, JavaScript, NodeJS, and proficiency in cloud platforms such as AWS and Google Cloud. I hold certifications in Cloud DevOps Engineering from Udacity and Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals, demonstrating my commitment to staying current with industry trends.

In my current role at FPT Software, I have contributed to various projects, showcasing my ability to develop back-end systems, implement automation pipelines, and manage infrastructure utilizing technologies like ReactJS, NodeJS, Google Cloud SQL, and AWS services.

I have led successful initiatives such as migrating systems, automating deployment processes, and improving customer performance through efficient solutions. Notably, I led a team to convert customer documents to Google App Script, resulting in a significant increase in efficiency.

Outside of work, I am passionate about software development, DevOps practices, and cloud technologies. I have undertaken side projects to explore and implement innovative solutions, such as my project AAS, where I reduced delivery time through automation using AWS services and other tools.

With a strong foundation in software engineering and a proactive approach to learning and problem-solving, I am eager to leverage my skills and experience to contribute to challenging projects and drive impactful outcomes in the software industry.
